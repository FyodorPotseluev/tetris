                                Description

    Yet another implementation of the famous Tetris game.

                                Prerequisites

    Apart from the standard C library, it relies on the `unistd` library, so it won't run natively on Windows or other non-Unix platforms.

                                Installation

    Run `make` in a terminal window in the project directory.

                                Usage

    Run `make run` in a terminal window in the project directory to start the game.

    When the game is ended (or if you pressed the `Esc` key), you will see the `highscore` window. To close it press the `Esc` key.

    Run `make help` to see the list of Makefile commands.
